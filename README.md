## About
Learn the very basics of Java coding by building a simple tool for zookeepers. Get to know how to work with variables, 
strings and arrays, put them in while loops and develop a simple console app from scratch.

## What you'll learn
Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course 
to get it built. Hereâ€™s what awaits you:

- Stage 1/4: Print first lines of code
  - First, let's try to get some simple output from your code.
  - Stage Topics:
    - Introduction to Java
    - Basic literals: numbers, strings and characters
    - Writing first program
    - Printing data
    - Types and variables
    - Coding style conventions
    - Naming variables
- Stage 2/4: Print an image of the animal
  - Show the zookeeper an image of her ward.
  - Stage Topics:
    - Comments
    - Reading user's input with Scanner
    - Arithmetic operations
    - Integer types and operations
    - Increment and decrement
    - Floating-point types
    - Boolean type and operations. True and false
    - Characters
    - String
    - Formatted output
    - Text blocks
- Stage 3/4: Show where animals live
  - The zookeeper wants to know what is inside each habitat, by its number.
  - Stage Topics:
    - Data types and their sizes
    - Type casting
    - Calling methods
    - Primitive and reference types
    - Array
- Stage 4/4: Set the program for zoo staff
  - Finally, your program is able to work for as long as needed!
  - Stage Topics:
    - Comparing values. Relational operators
    - Conditional statement
    - One-line condition with ternary operator
    - For loop
    - While and do-while loops
    - IDE
    - What are bugs
    - Debugging overview
