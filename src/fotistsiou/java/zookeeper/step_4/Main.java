/**
 * Set the program for zoo staff
 * -----------------------------
 * Description
 * Now it's time to make our project user-friendly. In this final stage, you'll make your software ready for the zoo
 * staff to use. Your program should understand the habitat numbers, show the animals, and be able to work continuously
 * without having to be restarted.
 * -----------------------------
 * Objectives
 * Your tasks at this point:
 * 1. Your program should repeat the behavior from the previous stage, but now in a loop.
 * 2. Do not forget to include an exit opportunity: inputting exit should end the program.
 * 3. When the program is done running, it should print: See you later!
